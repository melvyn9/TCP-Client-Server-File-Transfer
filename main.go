// CLARIFIER ON BINARY.WRITE AND CONN.WRITE FROM DISCUSSION:
// Theoretically you can swap out our binary.write and conn.write calls and still get the client-server interaction to work. But there are trade offs:
// binary.write allows you to quickly and cleanly send non-slice data over the wire without having to convert it to a slice. For instance, if I was to replicate
// err = binary.Write(conn, binary.BigEndian, uint32(len(filenameBytes))) using conn.Write it would look like _, err = conn.Write([]byte{byte(len(filenameBytes) >> 24), byte(len(filenameBytes) >> 16), byte(len(filenameBytes) >> 8), byte(len(filenameBytes))})
// However, with conn.Write you do get feedback from the function on how many bytes you actually were able to send, which based on the network we can't guarantee all the time.
// If at bytesWritten, err := conn.Write(buffer[:bytesRead]) we chose to use binary.Write, which does NOT provide such feedback, it leads to the possibility our count of the bytes written could be wrong.
